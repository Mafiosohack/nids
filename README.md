Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
🔐 Overview

This project is a modular Network-Based Intrusion Detection System built in Python.
It captures network traffic, extracts flow-based features, applies machine learning models, and generates security alerts for anomalous or malicious behavior.

The system is designed for:

Educational security research

Lab-based attack simulation

Cloud log analysis extension

Future IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) expansion
